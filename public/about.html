<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio website. <br/> My name's Adam Elijah and I'm currently a full-time truck driver studying web development to earn a pay raise to provide my future family a better life. I enjoy watching basketball and hockey, practicing MMA, listening to R&B music and creating music myself. I'm self-driven, ambitious, hold myself to extremely high standards and dedicated to achieving my personal goals so you can feel 100% confident that you'll receive all the value you're looking for when hiring an individual. Thanks once again for your time and looking forward to meeting you! </p>
